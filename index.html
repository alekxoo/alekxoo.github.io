        Om's Observations
    </h1>

    <h3>Hi there! Welcome to my website! 👋</h3>
    <p>I am a second-year at The University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Plan II Honors.</p>
    <p>This summer, I will be working at Intel in The Numerical Hardware Group, a new applied research group within Intel's graphics group that focuses on computer arithmetic and mathematical hardware.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Last fall, I took ECE courses on quantum mechanics, lasers, and linear systems and signals, part one of Plan II's philosophy sequence, an interdisciplinary course on quantum information science, and classical mechanics. I was also a first violinist in the UT University Orchestra!</p>
    <p>I am currently taking introductory solid-state physics, electromagnetic engineering, part one of the undergraduate algebraic structures sequence, part two of the quantum information science course from last semester, a course on applied linear algebra, and part two of Plan II's philosophy sequence. I am also still a first violinist in the UT University Orchestra!</p>
    <p>Here's a detailed list of <a href="/courses/">courses I've taken and some of my thoughts on them</a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I also enjoy collecting and reading textbooks, and recently I've been trying to read more books (especially nonfiction and science fiction).</p>
    <p>Here's a partial list of <a href="/books/">textbooks and books I've read and my thoughts on some of them</a>.
    <hr>
    <h3 class="text-center">Projects</h3>
    <p>I am currently modeling and designing a physical Rubik's Cube scrambling and solving robot, using an Ender 3 3D printer, six stepper motors, some motor drivers, and an Arduino Mega. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/q-_97nJyRBk">video</a> of it in action!</p>
    <p>I just finished designing this new website! It's a major aesthetic upgrade from my previous homepage, which only had unstyled HTML. If you want, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/omajoshi/omajoshi.com">source code</a>.</p>
    <p>Last year, I designed a <a href="https://iqt.txfa.org">tournament tabulation and point tracking program</a> for Texas' state high school speech and debate organization.</p>
    <p>I also developed and maintain an <a href="https://extemp.omajoshi.com">extemporaneous debate hosting platform</a> and have used it to host extemp draw at a few debate tournaments in my area.
    <p>Here are the rest of my <a href="/projects/">projects (page in progress)</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Writing</h3>
    <p>During the summer after junior year of high school, I started a blog so I could practice writing. I wrote a few posts about esoteric things like making a super PAC and exploring the Texas Administrative Code. Eventually I'll port it over to this site. Maybe I will also write more posts sometime.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="text-center">These are a Few Miscellaneous Things</h3>
    <p>As part of my recent foray into the Star Trek anthology, I started learning the Klingon language (via Duolingo).</p>
    <p>On weekend mornings, I enjoy going on long bike rides.</p>
    <p>Here is a <a href="/quotes/">collection of quotes</a> that were memorable to me and that I enjoy rereading from time to time.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="text-center">Contact Info</h3>
    <p>How to reach me: email firstname at website.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="text-center">Web Design</h3>
    <p>Here are my core web design principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Center headings</li>
        <li>Use &lt;hr&gt; tags to separate content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am currently NOT seeking a position as a front-end web designer.</p>
